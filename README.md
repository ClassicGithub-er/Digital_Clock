# Simple Web-Based Digital Clock

This is a project I thought of because any digital clocks I looked at online just had too much garbage on them, so I thought of this sleek digital clock design. It might seem simple, but deeper down, there are many aspects of this clock that make it so unique.

## Features:

- In the top right corner, there is a cog wheel which can be pressed to open an array of different buttons to customize the clock
- When pressing “D”, the “date” section will change from long format (Friday, October 11, 2022) to dd/mm/yy (11/10/22) and vice versa.
- When pressing “S”, a schedule will appear at the top of the screen (configurable in script.js) and will disappear when pressing “S” once more.
